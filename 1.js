// When to use Grids, When to use flexes in at least 100 words.
// Grids and flexes are two common CSS layout methods that are used to position and align elements within a web page.

// Grids are best suited for creating a structured layout that requires a defined number of rows and columns, such as a grid of photos, a spreadsheet-style layout, or a header and footer with multiple columns. Grids are particularly useful when you need to control the position of elements within a layout and ensure they align consistently.

// On the other hand, flexbox is ideal for creating flexible and responsive layouts, especially when dealing with dynamic content. Flexbox is especially useful for laying out elements in a single direction (row or column), as it allows elements to automatically wrap to the next line when they reach the end of their container. It also makes it easy to distribute available space between elements and align them along a main axis.

// In summary, grids are best for creating structured layouts, while flexbox is best for creating flexible and responsive layouts. The choice between the two will depend on the specific requirements of your layout, and sometimes a combination of both grid and flexbox can be used to achieve the desired result.
